This project is to test various accessiblity practices, and to provide additional accessibility options for commonly used tools such as boot strap.

Currently the following issues have been addressed as far boot strap and or accessiblity:
1. Bootstrap's contrast issue with its default color values.
2. Additional button sizes for larger button sizes.

Currently planned issues to test and address:
1. Better color blind options for applications.
2. Better Audio and visual feedback testing for website design.
